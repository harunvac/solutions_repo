# Problem 1

### **1. Theoretical Background**
The range \( R \) of a projectile launched at an initial velocity \( v_0 \) and angle \( \theta \) (from horizontal) in a vacuum is given by the equation:

\[
R = \frac{v_0^2 \sin(2\theta)}{g}
\]

where:
- \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity (9.81 m/s² on Earth),
- \( v_0 \) is the initial velocity,
- \( \theta \) is the launch angle.

### **2. Key Insights**
- The range is **maximum at** \( \theta = 45^\circ \).
- The function \( \sin(2\theta) \) is **symmetric** around \( 45^\circ \), meaning that an angle of \( 30^\circ \) and \( 60^\circ \) will give the same range.
- If air resistance is ignored, the only factors affecting range are \( v_0 \) and \( g \).

### **3. Simple Simulation**
Let's visualize this relationship by plotting the range \( R \) as a function of \( \theta \). I'll generate a quick graph.

Here’s the plot showing how the range varies with the angle of projection. 

### **Observations:**
- The range increases up to **45°**, reaching its maximum.
- The range then **decreases symmetrically** beyond 45°.
- The same range is obtained for **complementary angles** (e.g., 30° and 60° give the same range).

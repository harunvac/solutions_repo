Theoretical Background The range \\( R \\) of a projectile launched at an initial velocity \\( v_0 \\) and angle \\( \\theta \\) (from horizontal) in a vacuum is given by the equation: \\[ R = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin(2\\theta)}{g} \\] where: \\( g \\) is the acceleration due to gravity (9.81 m/s\u00b2 on Earth), \\( v_0 \\) is the initial velocity, \\( \\theta \\) is the launch angle. 2. Key Insights The range is maximum at \\( \\theta = 45^\\circ \\) . The function \\( \\sin(2\\theta) \\) is symmetric around \\( 45^\\circ \\) , meaning that an angle of \\( 30^\\circ \\) and \\( 60^\\circ \\) will give the same range. If air resistance is ignored, the only factors affecting range are \\( v_0 \\) and \\( g \\) . 3. Simple Simulation Let's visualize this relationship by plotting the range \\( R \\) as a function of \\( \\theta \\) . I'll generate a quick graph. Here\u2019s the plot showing how the range varies with the angle of projection. Observations: The range increases up to 45\u00b0 , reaching its maximum. The range then decreases symmetrically beyond 45\u00b0. The same range is obtained for complementary angles (e.g., 30\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 give the same range).","title":"Problem 1"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_1/#problem-1","text":"","title":"Problem 1"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_1/#1-theoretical-background","text":"The range \\( R \\) of a projectile launched at an initial velocity \\( v_0 \\) and angle \\( \\theta \\) (from horizontal) in a vacuum is given by the equation: \\[ R = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin(2\\theta)}{g} \\] where: \\( g \\) is the acceleration due to gravity (9.81 m/s\u00b2 on Earth), \\( v_0 \\) is the initial velocity, \\( \\theta \\) is the launch angle.","title":"1.
